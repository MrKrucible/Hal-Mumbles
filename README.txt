- How to Install This Mumble Skin

 To install this skin follow these steps.
1. Unzip this file.

2. Go to your Mumble installation (By default it's = C:\Program Files (x86)\Mumble )
and create a folder called "Skins". Without the quotations.

3. Place the unzipped file into the newly created "Skins" folder.

4. Launch Mumble, go to the "Configure" tab, then "Settings" from the drop down box,
and find "User Interface". From there you will see a button that says "Browse" under
Look and Feel.

5. Select the ".qss" file from the "Skins" folder in your Mumble installation. 
It should be  "vsoc_skin v1.1.qss".

 That is it! You're finished! Enjoy your new skin!
